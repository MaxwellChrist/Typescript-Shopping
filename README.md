I wanted to get better with react and typescript, and I found a cool API called fakestoreapi.com, so I decider to create a shopping cart list. It was pretty fun to do and I want to get better passing state around with typescript so I'll be practicing more of these projects in the near future. For this project, I found material UI to be an amazing library to easily customize components and for what I could not figure out, I created styles folders to hold the styling I used with the styled components library. Lastly, I used the react query library for easy state management when initially fetching the info from the API.
